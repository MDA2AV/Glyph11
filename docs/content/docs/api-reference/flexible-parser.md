{{< callout type="info" >}}
The `FlexibleParser` has been removed from Glyph11. Use [`HardenedParser`](hardened-parser) instead.
{{< /callout >}}

The `FlexibleParser` was an earlier parser without validation. It has been removed in favor of the `HardenedParser`, which provides the same performance with added security validation.

See the [HardenedParser documentation](../parsers/hardened-parser) for migration guidance.
